# Wrapper

# Prompt

Design and implement a standardized API response structure for a web application using Node.js (Express) as backend and React as frontend.

Backend (Node.js):

Create a generic response wrapper to handle success and error responses

Include metadata: timestamp, requestId, and optional pagination info

Support various data types: object, array, primitive

Use the Builder Pattern for structured response creation

Add status, message, and standardized error codes

Frontend (React):

Create a common API utility to parse and handle the standardized response

Display messages or data accordingly (e.g.,via  UI components)

Ensure uniform error and success feedback to the user
